# ‚úÖ Progress report 

1. ### **Early Gradle Issues**
   At the start of Coding Assignments 1 and 2, I spent a significant amount of time learning how to resolve Gradle configuration issues in Android Studio. This slowed down my initial development progress.
   
2. ### **Original Plan: Coin Clicker App**
   I initially worked on a **Coin Clicker App** and had completed roughly 75% of it, which would have accounted for Coding Assignments 2 & 3.
   
3. ### **Project Loss & Studio Crash** 
   Unfortunately, my project was lost due to a crash in Android Studio. I mistakenly deleted a critical Gradle file while troubleshooting, which caused the project to become unrecoverable. I reached out to my instructor for support, and he was very understanding and flexible.
   
4. ### **Backup Plan: Modify the NewsApp**
   Due to time constraints and workload from other courses, I planned to modify the **NewsApp tutorial project** to meet the assignment requirements while making it functionally and visually different.
   
5. ### **API Limitations** 
   I began by changing layout colors and API data within the NewsApp. However, I discovered that the default API did not support switching between countries as I had hoped.
   
6. ### **Final Pivot: Pok√©mon API Integration** 
   Inspired by my instructor‚Äôs use of a **Pok√©mon API**, I decided to pivot to a new idea and integrate this API instead. This change came very late in the term but felt achievable given the simplicity of the Pok√©mon data structure.

7. ### **Recovery Strategy**
   Given my previous setbacks with Android Studio, I focused on building a version of the app that would be stable, functional, and well-scoped for the assignment requirements.

8. ### **Pok√©mon API Integration**
   After pivoting to use the Pok√©mon API, I set out to integrate it into my app. This was a fresh start with a new set of challenges, but the structure of the Pok√©mon data was more straightforward compared to the NewsApp API I had initially tried.

9. ### **Initial Setup and Retrofit Integration**
   The first step was to integrate Retrofit to make API calls. I created a `PokemonApi.kt` interface, defining endpoints for fetching the Pok√©mon data from the Pok√©API.
   This integration went smoothly at first, and I was able to make successful API requests and retrieve data for Pok√©mon in a list format.

10.  ### **Room Database Setup**
   Since I wanted to store the user‚Äôs favorite Pok√©mon, I set up a `Room` database. I created an entity, `FavoritePokemon`, to store the selected Pok√©mon, and I created the DAO (`FavoritePokemonDAO`) to handle insertions and queries.
   I then implemented a `PokemonRepository` class to act as a middle layer, abstracting the interaction between the database and the UI layer (i.e., `PokemonViewModel`).

11. ### **ViewModel and UI Updates**
   I worked on the `PokemonViewModel` to manage data fetching and database interactions, exposing a `LiveData` list of favorite Pok√©mon for the UI. I implemented a click listener in the `PokemonAdapter` to allow users to add or remove Pok√©mon from their favorites list. This involved using `LiveData` to observe changes and update the UI automatically.

12. ### **Challenges and Errors Encountered**
   While I was able to set up most of the core functionality for the app, I ran into a few persistent errors that I had to address along the way.

13. ### **Unresolved References and Typo Errors**
   I faced a few errors related to unresolved references in my code. One common issue was a simple typo in variable names, such as the misnamed `_filteredPokemonL` instead of `_filteredPokemonList`. This caused a chain of errors, but once I identified the mistake and corrected it, everything worked smoothly again.

14. ### **Retrofit and Gson Parsing Issues**
   I ran into issues parsing the Pok√©mon data returned from the API. Initially, the response wasn‚Äôt mapping correctly to my data model. This was because the JSON structure I was receiving didn‚Äôt directly match my Kotlin data class.
   I had to adjust my data model to match the exact structure of the response and use Gson annotations to handle some of the discrepancies, such as handling nested objects in the response.

15. ### **Gradle Sync Issues and Dependency Conflicts** 
   Throughout the project, I encountered various Gradle sync issues, particularly when updating dependencies like Retrofit and Gson. Some updates conflicted with other dependencies, causing issues with building the app.
   I resolved these by carefully checking the Gradle versions and ensuring all libraries were compatible with the version of Android Studio I was using.

16. ### **RecyclerView Adapter and Binding Errors**
   Another issue I faced was binding the Pok√©mon list data correctly in the `RecyclerView`. I had set up data binding with the adapter, but there were issues where the adapter wasn‚Äôt notifying the `RecyclerView` of updates after adding or removing favorites.
   In the `PokemonFragment.kt` file, I updated the list of favorite Pok√©mon by calling `submitList()` on the `PokemonAdapter`. This ensures the `RecyclerView` is efficiently updated with the new data without the need for manually calling `notifyDataSetChanged()`.

17. ### **Final Stages: Testing and Debugging**
   Once the main error free structure was in place, I began researching testing.Moving  forward, i will focus on unit testing the ViewModel and Repository to ensure the logic is correct. Also, write UI tests to check if user interactions, like clicking items or adding favorites, work as expected. For debugging, use log statements and the Android Studio Debugger to track issues. Test on different devices and edge cases to ensure stability and smooth performance.

## üìö What I Learned

1. **Error Reading Is Key**
   Carefully reading each error message‚Äîline by line‚Äîwas one of the most valuable lessons. It helped me understand where problems were happening and how to fix them methodically.
   
  
2. **Build Process Awareness**
   I learned how important it is to understand the build process of Android apps. Knowing when and why to clean, rebuild, or restart the IDE helped me navigate difficult development moments.
   

3. **Adaptability in Development**
   Being flexible and pivoting between project ideas (Coin Clicker ‚Üí NewsApp ‚Üí Pok√©monApp) was a challenging but important skill. In a real-world scenario, adapting to issues and deadlines is essential.
   

4. **Importance of Backups**
   Losing a project due to a crash taught me the importance of version control (GitHub) and frequent backups. I now plan to use Git consistently for future projects.
   
5. **Project Structure and Design Approach**
   Initially, I struggled to determine which files were necessary and found it difficult to remember the project structure. As a result, I created many files while experimenting, but later had to delete several of them as they were unnecessary. Through this process, I gained a better understanding of the overall project structure and design. Moving forward, I plan to start with a visual layout on paper to better organize the structure and minimize development time, as this approach aligns with my learning style.

# üì± Pok√©mon Android App ‚Äì Project Structure & Explanation

   This Section outlines the structure and purpose of each file in my Pok√©mon app, it explains how it is aligned with my assignment requirements. Room, RecyclerView, Fragments, ViewModel, LiveData, and more.



üìö **Note:**
   During the development process, I reached a point where it became necessary to remove the remaining files from the original NewsApp structure. After closely analyzing and mirroring its design and architecture, I determined that fully removing the parallel NewsApp components would help minimize potential conflicts and simplify debugging efforts moving forward.



---




## **App Design**

 The app follows the **MVVM architecture**, where the **Model** handles data, the **View** displays UI elements, and the **ViewModel** manages business logic. **Retrofit** is used for fetching Pok√©mon data from an API, and **Room** stores favorites locally. The app uses **Fragments** with **RecyclerViews** to display data and **bottom navigation** for easy navigation between sections. Error handling is managed using the `Resource` class, and the design allows for easy scalability and future feature additions. The project is structured for maintainability and reusability, making it flexible for future updates or device adjustments.

## **Issues I faced:**

**JDK Compatibility Issue with Android Studio**

During the setup of my Android Studio project, I encountered issues with Java Development Kit (JDK) compatibility. The project required JDK 8 for proper compilation, but I was running a newer version of OpenJDK (JDK 21). This mismatch caused errors during build and sync, as the project couldn‚Äôt recognize or use the correct version of JDK.

**Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue:**

Installed JDK 8: I installed the appropriate version of JDK (AdoptOpenJDK 8) which is compatible with Android development.

Set Up JDK 8 in Android Studio: I updated Android Studio's SDK Location settings and Gradle properties to point to the correct JDK 8 folder.

Configured JAVA_HOME: I set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to ensure Android Studio and Gradle would use JDK 8 for building and running the project.

Gradle Sync: After making the changes, Still Android Studio continued to use its default JDK, which is a newer version then the one I was attempting to use. 

**Note: Issue Ongoing - I moved the file to another location but still issues**


**Challenges Faced:**

`gradle.properties`
Path issues with special characters and spaces in folder names caused some initial errors. Attempts were made to resolve this by correctly formatting the paths and ensuring proper escaping for spaces and backslashes, but all seemed to now work. 

### üöß **Example of Issue I‚Äôm Facing:**üöß 

Based on my error and research on it,
I‚Äôm still currently dealing with a `java.lang.IllegalAccessError` that occurs when trying to run the app. The error is happening because Kotlin‚Äôs annotation processing tool, Kapt, is trying to access a class (JavaCompiler) that is part of the jdk.compiler module, but this module doesn‚Äôt export its internal classes to Kapt. This is causing a conflict because the new JDK version (21) is more restrictive about access to internal Java modules.


### üöß**Error Messages**üöß  


üöß **1**
![New-ISSUE](image/issue-1.png)

**Note:** This issue is unlikely to be directly caused by your code itself. It‚Äôs more related to the environment setup and how your project interacts with the Java Development Kit (JDK), Kotlin, and annotation processing (KAPT).


üöß **2**
![New-ISSUE](image/issue-2.png)

**Note:**
 This is the first time I have encountered this type of error.


üöß **3**
![Common-issue](image/issue-3.png)

**Note:** 
This is a common error I encounter and usually requires:
1. File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart
2. Click "Invalidate and Restart"
3. Close Android Studio
4. Navigate to your project folder
5. Delete the `build` folder
6. Reopen Android Studio
7. Sync Gradle
8. Rebuild Project
9. Restart the computer (if needed)


üöß **4**
![New-Warning](image/error-5.png)

**Note:**
The most likely cause is that the Gradle script hasn‚Äôt been properly synced or loaded, often due to issues with the Gradle configuration or connectivity problems.



### **Final Thoughts:**

Despite addressing all noticeable errors and cleaning up unused files, I am currently unable to run my app due to ongoing Gradle and configuration issues. While the app is free from significant errors, these build-related issues prevent me from fully testing its functionality. This makes it difficult to ensure the app is operating as expected, as I cannot perform necessary runtime tests to verify the implementation of features like data fetching, UI interactions, and database operations. These technical roadblocks are hindering the completion of my project, as testing and debugging are crucial for identifying any remaining issues and ensuring the app meets all requirements.
